<h2>Overview: </h2>
Information about your visualizations and what they show. Include information about interactions, preprocesses, and design as appropriate. Note what tasks the visualization allows you to accomplish to derive this insight and how your design is tailored to support these tasks.
<h3>Graph 1: </h3>
To create this graph I first ran it through python and created a pandas dataframe based on Country and Skill level that equaled ultra nerd. I then exported this as a CSV

For this graph, I designed it to show the count of people that answered they were an ultra nerd through the survey based on country. Each count is categorized by country and the height is associated with the amount of people that answered. When you highlight over it, it shows the exact count so you can compare more closesly.
<h3>Graph 2: </h3>
To create this graph I also ran it through python but did some more complex grouping. I first restructured the answers on a scale of 1-4. Luddite being a 1 and Ultra Nerd being a 4. I then performed a count on these.

<h3>Team Roles: </h3>

<h3>Running Instructions: </h3>
